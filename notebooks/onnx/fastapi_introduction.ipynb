    "# FastAPI - Building fast and scalable REST APIs with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "*COPYRIGHT NOTICE: Parts of this tutorial are from the (amazing) [fastapi docs](fastapi.tiangolo.com)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints.*\n",
    "\n",
    "As data scientists we usually build models that are trained on data and optimised on some metrics. At some point, a model needs to be integrated into existing processes, systems and applications. One way to do this is build a microservice that is running inference. FastAPI is a framework that will help us to build a quick REST API that can be integrated into the existing enterprise landscape. "

    "## What is a REST API?\n",
    "If REST APIs are new to you, feel free to read this article [API Guide for Data Scientists](https://www.enjoyalgorithms.com/blog/api-introduction-for-data-science-and-ml).\n",
    "\n",
    "An API is a set of protocols, routines, tools, and standards that **enable software applications to communicate with each other**. In other words, an API defines how software components should interact with each other and provides a way for developers to access the functionality of a particular application or service, without having to understand the underlying code.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **REST API** (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allows different applications to communicate over the web using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. For data scientists, it provides a way to access and manipulate data from remote servers, enabling seamless integration of data sources and machine learning models into their workflows."

    "## Why is FastAPI a great choice for inference?\n",
    "- **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic).\n",
    "- **Huge productivity**: It's very fast to code with FastAPI. In the docs they say the following: *Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%.*\n",
    "- **Fewer bugs**: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors.\n",
    "- **Intuitive**: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.\n",
    "- **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.\n",
    "- **Short**: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.\n",
    "- **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.\n",
    "- **Standards-based**: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema."
