    "# FastAPI - Building fast and scalable REST APIs with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "From the FastAPI docs: *FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+ based on standard Python type hints.*\n",
    "\n",
    "As data scientists we usually build models that are trained on data and optimised on some metrics. At some point, a model needs to be integrated into existing processes, systems and applications. One way to do this is build a microservice that is running inference. FastAPI is a framework that will help us to build a quick REST API that can be integrated into the existing enterprise landscape. "

    "## Why is FastAPI a great choice for inference?\n",
    "- High Performance: FastAPI sits on top of Starlette and Pydantic. Starlette is a very low level API framework. FastAPI provides a great abstraction around the Starlette Framework. Compared to other language like NodeJS and Go it provides a similar performance and is on one of the fastest Python frameworks that is available.\n",
    "- Huge productivity: It's very fast to code with FastAPI. In the docs they say the following: *Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%.*\n",
    "- Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors.\n",
    "- Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.\n",
    "- Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.\n",
    "- Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.\n",
    "- Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.\n",
    "- Standards-based: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema."
