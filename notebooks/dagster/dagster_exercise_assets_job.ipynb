    "# Data Pipeline Orchestration with Dagster Assets\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will get to know the basics of dagster Assets. Therefore, we will create a simple data pipeline for preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dagsters definition of Asset and SDA:\n",
    "> An asset is an object in persistent storage, such as a table, file, or persisted machine learning model. A software-defined asset is a description, in code, of an asset that should exist and how to produce and update that asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our use case we have a look at a song data set from Spotify. We want to clean the data, find and remove duplicates and prepare it, so we could use it to predict a songs music genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we planned a small preprocessing pipeline wich will perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load song data -> \"song_data\" Asset\n",
    "2. Remove unnecessary data -> \"data_cleaned\" Asset\n",
    "3. Extract Duplicates -> \"duplicates\" Asset\n",
    "4. Deduplicate data -> \"data_deduplicated\" Asset\n",
    "5. Perform one-hot-encoding on the 'key' column -> \"data_encoded\" Asset\n",
    "6. Standardize columns with a wide value range and save as a csv -> \"data_standardized\" Asset\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for these tasks is already provided. All you need to do is put their logic together in the form of a dagster asset graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the definitions are complete, we will have a look at the dagster UI and materialize the assets.\n",
    "In the end, we will define Asset jobs as an alternative way to materialize a set of assets and run them in the UI."
